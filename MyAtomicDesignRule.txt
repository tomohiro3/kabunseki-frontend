Organisms
  It's a component having multiple atoms or molecules and it has its own meaning.
  For example, SeacrhBar component in my project is organism.
  The component is some atoms and molecules mixed component and it's desgined to be used as only search bar component in any pages.
  If the component doesn't have the specific icon, seacrh icon, the component can be named as InputWithIcon and used as mail sender form submitter and so on.

How to differenciate the usecase of styled component and (s)css.
  I use styled component only for components in the components folder.
    For atoms, Applying only the particular styles.
    For molecules, TBD but could be same as the atoms.
    For organisms, Applying some styles to tweak globally applied styles to meet the specifc organism components' requirement.
  I use (s)css for global setting and page level of styles.
